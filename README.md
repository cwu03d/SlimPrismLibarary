# SlimPrismLibarary
Slim Prism Library for WPF development 

This a slim version of original Prism Library Version 6.0 from Microsoft Pattern and Practice team. The purpose of this library is to enpower developers to developing a WPF application with pure MVVM, i.e. without touching the code-behind at all. 

There is a not of cleanups to remove none essential features and dependency libraries. There is also update to the code style to align with C# 10 language features. Prism.WpfExt is added to make interactions such as Windows content swap, a client area replacement, show popup windows, display message boxes easier. Prism.WpfExt also makes showing locaized content possible, the functionality not possible by Prism.Wpf. 

During my past experience on developing system software for medical devices and laboratory instruments, I strongly feal that this version of stripped down yet enhanced Prism family of library be very helpful.

SlimPrismLibarary is for WPF only targeted on .Net Framework 4.8.1.  The build configuration is X64 only although you can change the build configuration for other platform.

You can directly reference the version 1.0.0.0 binaries from Builds directory, or build your own from the source files from Src\SlimPrismLibarary.sln.

Sample application will be uploaded shortly.
